<p>The Basic Guidelines for letter writing !! </p>
<p>First, let's tackle what NOT to do. That is much easier than trying to list everything you should do! So, avoid these things when writing your letters:
</p>
<ol start="1">
    <li>Don't tear down or ridicule other candidates or campaigns. We are here to spread the humanity and reach out, not to discredit others with the tactics they use. we're better
        than that. Stick to the facts and the policies!
    </li>
    <li>Try not to be political with your envelope or address to the recipient. By this we mean make an attempt to avoid 'fellow voter' in place of a name, putting lots of campaign
        stickers on the envelope, etc. These things are best included inside the envelope because people so often throw out political mailers, we don't want your letters to get
        trashed before they are even opened! &nbsp;
    </li>
    <li>Please don't claim to be officially affiliated with the Yang2020 campaign. We aren't affiliated, and that is actually our greatest strength - imagine the passionate support
        of people you never even asked it from! It's a powerful thing to be able to move people to action without paying them or the promise of an immediate reward, and the people
        we're reaching out to know that.
    </li>
    <li>Don't copy other people's letters, and try not to form-letter everyone. Understandably, some of us have problems writing out letter after letter by hand. If you do decide
        to type, at least make sure to add some personal touches like a note with a Yang sticker, an actual signature, handwritten address, etc. The point here is to be human-
        we're all happier to receive a thoughtful message, even if we disagree with it, rather than a machined blanket statement we may otherwise totally agree on.
    </li>
    <li>Don't get upset if you don't hear back. Chances are that you won't get very many letters back - and that's okay. If you want, consider adding an email address or phone
        number (you can get a google voice number free and make a new email address
        just for this if you want) We have a few documented instances where people have been moved to investigate Yang and even all-out caucus by the letters they were sent but
        never wrote back. That's what we're asking them to do, and it's great that they took the message and ran with it! Here's one Redditor's thoughts on it:
        <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/YangForPresidentHQ/comments/ei7nf3/i_think_i_like_yang">https://www.reddit.com/r/YangForPresidentHQ/comments/ei7nf3/i_think_i_like_yang</a>
    </li>
    <li>Stick to print rather than cursive handwriting, at least for the body of your message. We all know that cursive is beautiful when done well, but it's still hard to read for
        many people. Keep in mind that they need to be able to read what you're saying! Slow down and take as long as you need to write clearly.
    </li>
</ol>
<p>So, that's the 'don'ts' out of the way- now here are some of our suggestions for what to include in your mailpiece, if you get stuck for ideas:
</p>
<p>Dear _______________,</p>
<p>Introduce yourself</p>
<p>Tell Your Yang Story</p>
<p>Express why you endorse AndrewYang and/or his policies</p>
<p>Let them know voting information for their state</p>
<p>Let them know if and how they may further contact you</p>
<p>Thank them for their time</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Your name</p>
<p>P.S. apparently are the most read comments - this is where i tell them his audiobook is FREE on youtube. Consider adding something fun in a P.S. note
</p>
<ol start="1">
    <li>Include customizable flyers from <a href="https://yangcurious.com">https://yangcurious.com</a>.
        This is a huge resource, as it's highly customizable for the type of content you want as well as the area
        you're writing! More printables on <a href="https://yangprints.com">YangPrints.com</a>
        Just be sure not to use anything too content-dense, because that's the best way to make someone's eyes gloss over
        and they may just outright ignore you.
    </li>
    <li>Tell them how you got Yanged. They don't want just mindless stats and pushy rhetoric. They will engage with what you have to say if you put some of yourself into it.
    </li>
    <li>Include whatever you are comfortable with and anything extra that you may want. Yang bucks, holiday cards, and campaign stickers are all good options. If you can afford it,
        consider sending an envelope with a stamp for them to reply to you with or include an email address that they
        can contact you with- you can make one just for this. You could also send them here!
    </li>
    <li>Keep in mind the area you're writing to. Different places have different needs and concerns. Do a bit of research on the town and its needs, and see if any relate to your
        community. Elaborate on why you think yang will help you both.
    </li>
    <li>If you have the skill (or not!), add art and make it look like you really put time into it. Because we're sure you did! Make it pretty. Make it jump out at them, and let
        them know it's not just random junk mail.
    </li>
    <li>If all else fails, post your questions in the facebook group. The community is here to help! email me at <a href="mailto:witlovesmath@gmail.com">witlovesmath@gmail.com</a>
