<h2>Hello PenPals for Yang Family!</h2>

<p>Thank you for volunteering your time to help make this project happen!</p>

<p>The goal is to send handwritten letters, but many have found typing letters
    to work best for them. If you end up typing out letters, please try to include
    a small handwritten note, hand write the address on the envelope and sign
    your name for the HUMANITY FIRST touch!</p>

<p>*this is your letter and your future penpal so please include whatever you are
    comfortable with and anything extra that you may want (yang buck, holiday card,
    yang stickersâ€¦) and if you can afford it consider sending an envelope w/ stamp
    for them to reply to you with or include an email address that they can contact
    you with - you can make one just for this*</p>

<p>We are writing letters to people in IOWA so consider their perspective:</p>

<p><strong>Donald Trump</strong> won the election in Iowa with 51.1% of the vote.
    <strong>Hillary Clinton</strong> received 41.7% of the vote. <strong>Trump</strong>
    carried Iowa by the largest margin of any Republican candidate since
    Ronald Reagan in 1980.</p>

<h3>Three Most Important Issues to Iowans</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Health Care</strong> (they want a realistic plan that will work and knows how
        it will be paid for, and wont cut out private insurance)
    </li>
    <li><strong>Climate Change</strong> (common questions: How would you address food insecurity
        and sustainable food production? How will the Green New Deal affect farmers?
        Will you commit to a goal of zero carbon emissions by 2030 and end taxpayer
        subsidies for fossil fuels?)
    </li>
    <li><strong>Education</strong> (common questions focus on college affordability and government
        support for public education)
    </li>
</ul>
